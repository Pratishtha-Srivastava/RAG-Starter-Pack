# RAG-Starter-Pack
A small, practical collection of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) examples. It shows how to scrape websites and CSVs, create embeddings (OpenAI / local models), store vectors with FAISS, and build simple retrieval-based chat interfaces (CLI and Streamlit). An initiative for learning, prototyping, and learning core RAG concepts.
